ANALYSIS OF PYMOLI DATA - OBSERVABLE TRENDS

1.Although males make up an overwhelming majority of player and purchasing totals (between 80-85% in both categories), the purchasing tendencies of players who do not identify as male (16%) should not be ignored in respect to their revenue generation potential, as this group on average spend 10% more per person than male players (reflected in this data set as average expenditure of 40-45 cents higher than male expenditure).

2.Repeatedly purchased items tend to be a higher price than the average item price ($3.05). For example the prices of the top 4 multiple purchased items (each of which had between 9-12 repeat purchases) ranged between $3.53 and $4.90 which translates to 15%-60% above the average item price. This would indicate that repeat purchasers are not solely focused on prices (lowest cost) when making purchasing decisions, meaning that players are likely to be willing and able to pay above average cost based on other factors such as quality, reputation, etc.

3.There is a strong correlation based on age between player percentages and purchase/revenue percentages. For example the 15-24 age range constitute 63% of total players, while this age bracket also represent 64% of purchase and revenue totals. As the 15-29 age range represents over three quarters of the the total players (78%) this age bracket should continue to be focused on in terms of playing and purchasing habits, trends, etc.
