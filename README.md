ANALYSIS OF PYMOLI DATA - OBSERVABLE TRENDS

1.Although males make up an overwhelming majority of player and purchasing totals (around 80-85% within both categories) the purchasing tendencies of players who do not identify as male (16%) should not be ignored in respect to their revenue generation potential as this group on average spend 10% more per person than male players. This difference is evident in this particular data set by the average expenditure of non-male players being on average 40-45 cents higher than average expenditure by male players.

2.Repeat purchases of items tend to be of a higher price than the average item price ($3.05). For example the prices of the top 4 multiple purchased items (each of which had between 9-12 repeat purchases) ranged between $3.53 and $4.90 which translates to 15%-60% above the average item price. This would indicate that repeat purchasers are not solely focused on low price and are likely willing and able to pay above average cost based on other factors such as quality, etc.

3. There is a strong correlation between player percentages and purchase/revenue percentages based on age. For example the 15-24 age range constitute 63% of total players while this age bracket also represent 64% of purchase and revenue totals. As the 15-29 age range represents over three quarters of the the total players (78%) this age bracket should continue to be focused on in terms of playing and purchasing habits, trends, etc.
